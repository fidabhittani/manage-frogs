# manage-frogs
This application is related to managing frogs in a pond. Nodejs and Vuejs

I was trying to create a simplest grid with VueJS and Nodejs on the server, There is no DB used, Its just a JSON file which saves the Frogs details direectly, I couldnt spare time to even do the form validation, 
But the structure is good if you wants to get started with Nodejs and VueJS.
